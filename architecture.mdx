Ekiden's architecture provides speed, transparency, and resilience through a hybrid design that balances off-chain performance with on-chain trust. It operates across three key layers:

- Client Layer
- Infrastructure Layer
- Smart Contract Layer

## 1. Client Layer

The Client Layer is the entry point for all user interactions. Users engage with the platform through:

- **Non-Custodial Aptos Wallet** – Users maintain full control of their assets.
- **Ekiden CLOB dApp** – Interface to submit orders and view the order book.
- **Ekiden API** – Programmatic trading access for algorithmic strategies.
- **Submit Orders** – Market and limit order support.
- **Deposit/Withdraw** – Vault-based funds management.

## 2. Infrastructure Layer

Handles all off-chain operations for high-speed trading.

- **Preprocessing Engine** – Validates and processes orders.
- **Matching Engine** – Matches orders in real-time.
- **Liquidation Engine** – Ensures solvency through liquidation.
- **Orderbook Root Hash** – Anchored on-chain for transparency.
- **Inclusion Proofs** – Merkle proofs provide auditability.

## 3. Smart Contract Layer

Runs on Aptos to ensure decentralized settlement and state integrity.

- **Orderbook Verifier** – Validates trades using Merkle proofs.
- **Clearinghouse** – Manages collateral and finalizes trades.
- **Position Registry** – Tracks open positions, supports withdrawals.
- **Vaults** – Modular and secure fund storage.
- **State Updates** – Settlements and balances are updated on-chain.

## Hybrid Design

Ekiden’s architecture combines:

- **Off-chain speed** – Fast matching, low latency, and scalable infrastructure.
- **On-chain integrity** – Transparent and trustless anchoring on Aptos.

This hybrid model delivers the performance of centralized exchanges with the security and control of DeFi platforms.
