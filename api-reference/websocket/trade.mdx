## Events

Messages arrive with `op: "event"`, `topic: "trade.<symbol>"`, and `data` containing an array of `PublicTrade`.

Example:

```json
{
	"op": "event",
	"topic": "trade.BTCUSDC",
	"server_ts_ms": 1731541800000,
	"data": [
		{ "id": "9723498234", "side": "buy",  "price": "100200", "size": "1", "seq": 12345, "timestamp": 1718000000 },
		{ "id": "7349823987", "side": "sell", "price": "100100", "size": "2", "seq": 12346, "timestamp": 1718000001 }
	]
}
```

Notes:
- `price` and `size` are strings to preserve precision.
- `seq` is the max sequence among fills aggregated into the trade; `timestamp` is the latest fill timestamp (seconds).
- `server_ts_ms` is the gateway processing time in milliseconds.

See schema details in [AsyncAPI](../websockets/public): `PublicTrade`.

### Trade ID

Field `id` is a stable string identifier for a given aggregated trade and unique within a market.

You can treat `id` + `symbol` as a primary key. Do not assume ordering by `id`; rely on provided `seq` and `timestamp`.
