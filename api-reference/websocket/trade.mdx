- Stream: Public (`wss://api.ekiden.fi/ws/public`)

## Subscribe

```json
{ "op": "subscribe", "args": ["trade/0x88a70ff..."], "req_id": "102001" }
```

Ack:

```json
{ "op": "subscribed", "args": ["trade/0x88a70ff..."], "req_id": "102001" }
```

## Events

Messages arrive with `op: "event"`, `topic: "trade/{addr}"`, and `data` containing `trades`.

Example:

```json
{
	"op": "event",
	"topic": "trade/0x88a70ff...",
	"data": {
		"market_addr": "0x88a70ff...",
        "trades": [
			{ "id": 9723498234, "side": "buy",  "price": "100.2", "qty": "1", "ts": 1681234567890123458 },
			{ "id": 7349823987, "side": "sell", "price": "100.1", "qty": "2", "ts": 1681234567890123459 }
		],
		"ts": 1681234567890123460
	}
}
```

See schema details in [AsyncAPI](../websockets/public): `AggregatedTrades`, `Trade`.

### Trade ID

Field `id` is a 64â€‘bit unsigned integer, stable for a given aggregated trade and unique within a market. It is derived from a hash of `(market_addr, price, side, seq, timestamp)` after aggregation:

- Multiple fills at the same `price` & `side` inside the same execution window collapse into one aggregated trade sharing a single `id`.
- Identical (price, side, seq, timestamp) on different markets produce different IDs (market included in hash).
- If the same batch is replayed (e.g. recovery) the `id` remains stable, aiding client deduplication.

You can treat `id` + `market_addr` as a primary key. Do not assume ordering by `id`; rely on provided `seq` and `ts`.
