title: "Rate Limits"
---

Ekiden enforces uniform rate limits across all API endpoints to ensure fair usage and system stability. Rate limiting prevents any single client from overloading the platform, so all users experience a consistent, high-performance trading API.

> **Note:** All rate limits are subject to change as we balance demand and reliability. Ekiden may adjust these limits over time to maintain optimal performance.

## Rate Limit Policy

Ekiden’s REST API rate limits apply **globally** – there is a single limit on requests across all endpoints.

- **Global request limit:** **100 requests per 10 seconds** (aggregate across all REST endpoints). Brief bursts above this are tolerated, but sustained requests beyond this threshold will be rejected.
- **Enforcement scope:**
  - **Public (unauthenticated) endpoints:** Tracked per **IP address**.
  - **Private (authenticated) endpoints:** Tracked per **API key** _and_ per **IP address**.
- **Behavior on exceedance:**
  - Response: **HTTP 429 – Too Many Requests**
  - Error code: `2003`
  - Message: `"Rate limit exceeded"`
- **Rate limit headers:**
  - `Retry-After`- number of seconds to wait before retrying (typically **60 seconds**).\
    Clients **must** pause requests until the indicated time has passed.

## Best Practices

- **Throttle requests:** Ensure you do not exceed 100 requests in any rolling 10-second window.
- **Use WebSockets for real-time data:** Ideal for high-frequency updates instead of frequent REST polling.
- **Handle 429 responses gracefully:**
  - Respect the `Retry-After` header.
  - Wait the specified time before retrying.
- **`Check for error code 2003:`** Helps your application identify rate limit issues.
- **Need higher limits?**\
  Contact the Ekiden team (e.g., via Discord) for options like colocated infrastructure and custom limits.

## Example: 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 60

{
  "error_code": 2003,
  "error_message": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```
