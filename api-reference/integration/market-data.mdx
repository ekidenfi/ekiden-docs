### **Sources**

- REST: see API Reference for `/api/v1/market/*` endpoints (candles, fills, market_info, funding)
- GraphQL (snapshots/queries): https://hasura.ekiden.fi/v1/graphql
- WebSocket (real-time):
	- Public: `wss://api.ekiden.fi/ws/public` (or staging)
	- Private: `wss://api.ekiden.fi/ws/private` (requires JWT auth)

### **Common Subscriptions**

- Orderbook snapshots and deltas: `orderbook/{market_addr}`
- Trades (aggregated): `trade/{market_addr}`
- Ticker snapshots: `ticker/{market_addr}`
- Private user streams (on private WS after auth): `order`, `position`, `fill`

### Timestamps

- Ticker snapshots use `ts` in milliseconds.
- WS ping/pong use nanoseconds for `ts`/`client_ts`/`server_ts`.
- See Conventions â†’ Timestamps for the full matrix.
