### **REST Endpoints**

- **Get Orders**: GET /api/v1/orders
- **Get User Orders**: GET /api/v1/user/orders
- **Place Order**: POST /api/v1/user/intent (order_create payload)
- **Cancel Order**: POST /api/v1/user/intent (order_cancel payload)

**SDK Examples**

```typescript
const order = await ekiden.createOrder({
  market_addr: "0x...",
  side: "buy",
  size: 100,
  price: 123.45,
  type: "limit",
  nonce: 1,
  signature: "0x..."
});
```

### Response fields

- `timestamp_ms` — Unix milliseconds when the order was created.
- `timestamp` — Unix seconds (deprecated; kept for backward compatibility).
- `is_cross` — true for cross margin, false for isolated.
- `initial_margin` — required initial margin for the order at current price/size (if available).

See full schema in OpenAPI for `OrderResponse`.

### Triggers and Brackets

- **Order field: `trigger_price`**
  - If set, the order is conditional and activates when the mark crosses the trigger (boundary equality applies). Direction is derived from side and relation to current mark.

- **Bracket field: `bracket`**
  - Attach Take Profit / Stop Loss to an entry.
  - Structure:
    - `mode`: `FULL` or `PARTIAL`.
    - `take_profit` / `stop_loss`: `{ trigger_price, order_type: MARKET|LIMIT, limit_price? }` (`limit_price` required for LIMIT).
  - Execution semantics: reduce-only, IOC. MARKET legs are converted to LIMIT IOC with a slippage guard band.

- **Reduce-only**
  - Use `reduce_only: true` to prevent increasing exposure. Triggered bracket legs always enforce reduce-only.

See the dedicated page: TP/SL, Triggers, and Reduce-Only.
