### **REST**

- Send reduce-only order equal to position size.
- Or send a market order in the opposite direction.

### Position fields to watch

- `is_cross` — cross vs isolated margin mode.
- `maintenance_margin`, `initial_margin`, `leverage` — helpful for risk management.
- `liq_price` — estimated liquidation price (considers margin mode, maintenance ratio, funding, and leverage limits).
- `timestamp_ms` — last update time of the position in milliseconds (`timestamp` in seconds is deprecated).

See also: PnL, Margin & Funding for more details on cross vs isolated behavior.
