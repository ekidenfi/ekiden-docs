# Deposit & Withdraw
All deposits and withdrawals will be handled via the SDK, which will be available shortly
---

## Overview

Ekiden uses a smart contract-based margin bank to custody collateral for trading. Users can deposit multiple supported tokens to the margin bank and withdraw available (free) collateral at any time. All deposits and withdrawals are on-chain but occur on the same network as the Ekiden protocolâ€”no cross-chain bridging is required.

## Supported Tokens

Ekiden supports the following tokens as margin collateral:

USDC, USDC, USDe  

Check the /tokens endpoint or documentation for the most current list.

## Depositing Tokens

### Steps

- Ensure Wallet Connection to the correct network  
- Approve Token if required via ERC-20 approval transaction  
- Call Deposit Endpoint or SDK Method  


## SDK Methods (Examples)

### TypeScript

```ts
await client.depositToMarginBank("USDC", "1000.00");
await client.withdrawFromMarginBank("USDC", "500.00");
```

### Python

```python
client.deposit(token="USDC", amount="1000.00")
client.withdraw(token="USDC", amount="500.00")
```


```

## Troubleshooting
