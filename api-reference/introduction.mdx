The Ekiden API provides a unified, high-throughput REST interface that connects both to the off-chain central limit order book (CLOB), where matching and execution take place, and to the on-chain settlement layer on Aptos. While most interactions happen off-chain, traders also perform on-chain actions via Aptos nodes using the Rust SDK - all through a single integrated API. 

All trading actions require digital signature authentication. Orders are matched off-chain for speed but are cryptographically verified and settled on-chain using Merkle proofs.

### **Connectivity & Integration**

Ekiden’s API is built for low-latency, high-throughput trading infrastructure:

- **REST** endpoints handle order execution, cancellation, market data, and account management.
- **WebSocket** streams provide real-time updates, including trade events, order book changes, and fills.

SDKs are available in multiple languages to streamline integration. Each SDK includes usage examples, setup instructions, and real-world integration patterns:

- `ekiden-sdk-typescript`: A full-featured SDK for Node.js and browser environments.
- `ekiden-sdk-rust`: Designed for high-performance, low-latency applications.
