The Ekiden API provides a unified high-throughput REST interface that connects both to the off-chain central limit order book (CLOB), where matching and execution take place, and to the on-chain settlement layer on Aptos.
While most interactions happen off-chain, traders also perform on-chain actions via Aptos nodes using the Rust SDK, all through a single integrated API.

All trading actions require digital signature authentication. Orders are matched off-chain for speed but are cryptographically verified and settled on-chain using Merkle proofs.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
