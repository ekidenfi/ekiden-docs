# Fee Tiers

Fees are based on your **rolling 30-day notional volume**. Maker fees drop to zero  and eventually negative as volume increases. Taker fees are flat or reduced at higher tiers.

| 30-Day Volume | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| \$0\+         | 0.0200%   | 0.0500%   |
| \$2.5M\+      | 0.0150%   | 0.0450%   |
| \$5M\+        | 0.0125%   | 0.0400%   |
| \$10M\+       | 0.0100%   | 0.0350%   |
| \$20M\+       | 0.0075%   | 0.0300%   |
| \$30M\+       | 0.0050%   | 0.0250%   |
| \$50M\+       | 0.0030%   | 0.0200%   |
| \$75M\+       | 0.0015%   | 0.0150%   |
| \$100M\+      | 0.0000%   | 0.0125%   |
| \$250M\+      | -0.0015%  | 0.0100%   |
| \$500M\+      | -0.0030%  | 0.0100%   |
| \$1B\+        | -0.0050%  | 0.0100%   |

- Volume is calculated across all perpetuals.
- Tiers update in real time and apply immediately.
- Negative maker fees = rebate paid on execution.

## Market Share Rebates

If your maker volume accounts for a meaningful share of a specific market, you’ll earn additional rebates on top of your tier.

| Maker Share (per market) | Extra Maker Rebate |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| ≥ 0.5%                   | -0.001%            |
| ≥ 1.0%                   | -0.002%            |
| ≥ 3.0%                   | -0.003%            |
