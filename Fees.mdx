## Fee Tiers

Fees are based on your **rolling 30-day trading volume** (USD notional). Maker orders (add liquidity) have lower fees — and at high volumes, you even get rebates. Taker orders (remove liquidity) pay slightly more.

| 30-Day Volume | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| \$0\+         | 0.0200%   | 0.0500%   |
| \$2.5M\+      | 0.0150%   | 0.0450%   |
| \$5M\+        | 0.0125%   | 0.0400%   |
| \$10M\+       | 0.0100%   | 0.0350%   |
| \$20M\+       | 0.0075%   | 0.0300%   |
| \$30M\+       | 0.0050%   | 0.0250%   |
| \$50M\+       | 0.0030%   | 0.0200%   |
| \$75M\+       | 0.0015%   | 0.0150%   |
| \$100M\+      | 0.0000%   | 0.0125%   |
| \$250M\+      | -0.0015%  | 0.0100%   |
| \$500M\+      | -0.0030%  | 0.0100%   |
| \$1B\+        | -0.0050%  | 0.0100%   |

## Maker Share Rebates

If you’re a top liquidity provider in a specific perp market, you can earn **extra rebates** on top of your fee tier.

| Maker Share (per market) | Extra Maker Rebate |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| ≥ 0.5%                   | -0.001%            |
| ≥ 1.0%                   | -0.002%            |
| ≥ 3.0%                   | -0.003%            |

These stack on top of your volume tier. Applied automatically. No opt-in needed.

Ekiden’s fee system is built to reward both activity and liquidity. Lower fees the more you trade. Rebates the more you contribute.
