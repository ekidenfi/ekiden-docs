description: "Ekiden is built for serious traders. Our fee structure is designed to reward both volume and liquidity. If you’re trading size or consistently making markets, you’ll benefit from lower costs and in many cases, get paid to provide liquidity.  Fees are calculated using a standard maker-taker model, with rates determined by your 30-day notional volume. Maker rebates kick in at higher tiers, and market share incentives offer additional rewards for dominating individual perp markets. All fee logic is transparent, predictable, and optimized for performance."

## Fee Tiers

Fees are based on your **rolling 30-day notional volume**. Maker fees drop to zero and eventually negative as volume increases. Taker fees are flat or reduced at higher tiers.

# Perp Fees

Ekiden is built for serious traders. Our fee structure is designed to reward both volume and liquidity. If you’re trading size or consistently making markets, you’ll benefit from lower costs — and in many cases, get paid to provide liquidity. Fees are calculated using a standard maker-taker model, with rates determined by your 30-day notional volume. Maker rebates kick in at higher tiers, and market share incentives offer additional rewards for dominating individual perp markets. All fee logic is transparent, predictable, and optimized for performance.

## Market Share Rebates

If your maker volume accounts for a meaningful share of a specific market, you’ll earn additional rebates on top of your tier.

| Maker Share (per market) | Extra Maker Rebate |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| ≥ 0.5%                   | -0.001%            |
| ≥ 1.0%                   | -0.002%            |
| ≥ 3.0%                   | -0.003%            |
