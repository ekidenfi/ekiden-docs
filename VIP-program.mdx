title: "VIP Taker Program"
description: "This page outlines the Ekiden VIP Taker Program, a reward system designed for all traders executing significant taker flow on Ekiden’s perpetual markets."
---

The program is designed to reward participants with rebates based on actual trading activity, using a transparent, volume-driven model.

## **1. Program Overview**

Professional traders with meaningful taker volume are eligible to receive rebates on trading fees.\
Rewards are distributed in **APT**, **USDC**, and **XP (convertible into EKI at TGE)**.

- Participants can earn back **up to 90%** of taker fees paid.
- Rebates are calculated monthly based on total fee spend and volume tier.
- The program will run for an initial **3-month campaign.**

## **2. Eligibility Requirements**

To qualify:

- **No Minimum Monthly Volume:** Everyone is rewarded. 
- **Minimum Fills:** 10 taker-side fills 
- **Window:** 30-day rolling window, reviewed daily

A “fill” is an individual matched trade resulting in execution.

## **3. Fee Rebate Structure**

Eligible takers receive monthly rebates based on taker fee spend. Rebates are split across:

- **APT** – subject to availability via ecosystem grants
- **USDC** – funded from Ekiden’s trading incentive pool
- **EKI** – credited as XP toward a future token allocation at TGE

### **3.1 Volume-Based Rebate Tiers**

| **30-Day Volume** | **Rebate % of Taker Fees Paid** |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ |
| \$0-\$10M         | 10%                             |
| \$10M-\$20M       | 20%                             |
| \$20M-\$30M       | 30%                             |
| \$30M–\$100M      | 50%                             |
| \$100M–\$500M     | 70%                             |
| \$500M\+          | 90%                             |

Rebates are calculated post-trade and distributed monthly to approved participants.

## **4. XP and EKI Incentives**

In addition to rebates, qualified takers earn **XP** based on their notional trading activity. XP determines a trader’s share of the **EKI token allocation at TGE**.

### **4.1 XP Formula**

XP = (\$ Notional Volume / 1,000) × Volume Multiplier

### **4.2 XP Multipliers**

| **7-Day Taker Volume** | **XP Multiplier** |
| :--------------------- | :---------------- |
| \$25M – \$100M         | 1.0x              |
| \$100M – \$500M        | 1.5x              |
| \$500M\+               | 2.0x              |

XP resets weekly and can unlock early access to markets, governance influence, and institutional-level support.

Rebates are calculated **after** taker fees are charged. Fees are paid at trade execution; rebates are returned monthly.

### **5.2 Rebate Example**

**Trader A** executes \$200M in taker volume over 30 days.

- Taker fee (from schedule): **0.0125%**
- Fees paid: \$200M × 0.000125 = **\$25,000**
- Rebate tier: **70%** → \$17,500 in rewards
- Split format:
  - **APT** (up to 50%)
  - **USDC** (up to 50%)
  - **EKI** – XP credited for future EKI allocation

Net effective cost: **\$7,500**, or **0.375 bps**
