### **Introduction**

Ekiden is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for institutional-grade performance and reliability. It features a hybrid architecture combining an off-chain, high-speed matching engine with on-chain smart contract settlement. This allows Ekiden to deliver trade execution comparable to top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs), while maintaining full self-custody and on-chain verification of trades.

By executing orders off-chain and settling them on-chain, Ekiden achieves ultra-low latency without requiring trust in a centralized custodian. The result is a platform that merges the speed of CEXs with the transparency and security of DeFi.

### **Our Vision**

**One orderbook. Infinite scalability. Built for the future.**

Ekiden redefines on-chain trading with lightning-fast performance and decentralized security. Through a hybrid design that posts compressed Merkle proofs on-chain and maintains full data off-chain, Ekiden operates as a scalable rollup - delivering deep liquidity, rapid execution, and trustless settlement. Whether you’re trading spot assets or managing perpetuals, or developing algorithmic trading strategies, Ekiden offers a unified institutional-grade platform. 

### **Key Features of Ekiden**

#### **Perpetual Futures Exchange**

Trade perpetuals with precision and scale:

- **Central Limit Orderbook (CLOB):** Off-chain order matching with on-chain Merkle proof commitments for transparent, auditable price discovery.
- **Deferred On-Chain Settlement:** Batched commitments of orderbook state changes posted to Aptos, optimizing throughput while ensuring verifiability.
- **Position Management:** Positions tracked via original order data against inclusion proofs in the orderbook and registry.
- **API Access:** Seamless integration for developing and executing algorithmic trading strategies at scale.
- **Price Discovery:** Driven by CLOB, with spot market integration planned.

#### **Spot Exchange**

Effortless spot trading, built for scale:

- **High-Performance Execution:** Low-latency trades with deep liquidity, powered by Aptos’ parallelized architecture.
- **Unified Platform:** Seamlessly switch between spot and perpetuals in one interface.
- **Aptos Advantage:** Near-instant settlement with minimal fees.

#### **Vaults: Secure & Modular Asset Management**

Ekiden’s Vaults are tailored for specific roles:

- **Deposits & Withdrawals:** Secure fund management with permissionless exits for user control.
