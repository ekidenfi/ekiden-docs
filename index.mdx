Ekiden is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for institutional-grade performance and reliability. It features a hybrid architecture combining an off-chain, high-speed matching engine with on-chain smart contract settlement.
This allows Ekiden to deliver trade execution comparable to top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs), while maintaining full self-custody and on-chain verification of trades.

By executing orders off-chain and settling them on-chain, Ekiden achieves ultra-low latency without requiring trust in a centralized custodian. The result is a platform that merges the speed of CEXs with the transparency and security of DeFi.
