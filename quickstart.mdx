Ekidenâ€™s API is built for low-latency, high-throughput trading infrastructure:
- REST endpoints handle order execution, cancellation, market data, and account management.
- WebSocket streams provide real-time updates, including trade events, order book changes, and fills.


SDKs are available in multiple languages to streamline integration. Each SDK includes usage examples, setup instructions, and real-world integration patterns:
